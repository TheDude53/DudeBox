# DudeBox
A custom version of trollbox from TheDude53, based on the backend of [dell-optiplex-790's tb-clone](https://github.com/dell-optiplex-790/tb-clone). Features a newly skinned and more mobile-friendly interface, as well as a lot of "DudeBox" branding.

## How to run
To start the server, simply run `npm i && npm run directStart` in the root project directory. You can change the server's port via the `PORT` environment variable, otherwise it will default to port 80.

Note: Because this is designed to run on Glitch, the main `npm start` command will run a script to sync with this repository before starting the server. It's only going to work properly if you're on Linux and have Git installed.
